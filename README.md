# GeneAnalyzer

The purpose of this project was to analyze a fasta file (.fa file) to read in each line of the data in the file and display information in an organized way. The program will show introns, extrons, gene name, the length of the gene, and more.
Run the gene analyzer with gene.fa file in the same directory.


# Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Go to the directory where you cloned the repository
3. Ensure that your gene data is stored in a file named `genes.fa`. Each gene should be formatted in the FASTA format and should be in the same directory.
4. Run the script by executing
5. The script will display information about each gene, including exon sequences, intron sequences, gene length, total exon length, number of exons, total intron length, number of introns, and the shortest gene sequence
