# GeneAnalyzer

The purpose of this project was to analyze a fasta file (.fa file) to read in each line of the data in the file and display information in an organized way. The program will show introns, extrons, gene name, the length of the gene, and more.
Run the gene analyzer with gene.fa file in the same directory.
